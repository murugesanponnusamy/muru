Operators usually Defines Custome Resorces that store their setting and configuration
The Syntax of CR is defined by CRD 
The purpose of an operator is usually to automate tasks that a human administrator (or human
operator) would perform to deploy, update, and manage an application.

=====================================================================
The Operator Framework is an open source toolkit for building, testing, and packaging operators.
The Operator Framework makes these tasks easier than coding directly to low-level KubernetesAPIs by providing the following components:

Operator SDK
Operator Life Cycle Manager

The Operator Framework also defines a set of recommended practices for implementing
operators and CRDs and a standard way of packaging an operator manifest, as a container image,
that allows an operator to be distributed using an operator catalog. The most common form of an
operator catalog is an image registry server.


OperatorHub provides a web interface to discover and publish operators that follow the Operator
Framework standards. Both open source operators and commercial operators can be published
to the Operator hub. Operator container images can be hosted at different image registries, for
example Quay.io.

Cluster operatores are managed OS clustor version operator and not by OLM 

OpenShift cluster operators provide OpenShift extension APIs and infrastructure services such as:
• The OAuth server, which authenticates access to the master and extensions APIs.
• The core DNS server, which manages service discovery inside the cluster.
• The web console, which allows graphical management of the cluster.
• The internal image registry, which allow developers to host container images inside the cluster,
using either S2I or another mechanism.
• The monitoring stack, which generates metrics and alerts about the cluster health.
